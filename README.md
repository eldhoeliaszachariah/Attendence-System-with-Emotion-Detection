The Attendance System Model project utilizes machine learning and computer vision to automate attendance tracking in educational environments.
It employs this system identify and recognize students' faces in real-time. When a student is detected, they are marked as "present," while those not detected are marked as "absent." Additionally, the system assesses students' facial expressions to gauge their emotions, offering a deeper insight into the classroom environment.

The system is designed to function within a specific time window, operating only between 9:30 AM and 10:00 AM, which helps ensure accurate and timely attendance recording. After the session concludes, the attendance and emotion detection data are saved in an Excel file, complete with timestamps for each student identified. This organization makes it easy to access attendance records for future use.
